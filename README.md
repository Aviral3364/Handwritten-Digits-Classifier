# Handwritten-Digits-Classifier
This CNN uses MNIST Database for training the model. This CNN model consists of two convolutional layers followed by three dense layers. Max pooling layers of (2,2) are clubbed with each convulution layers. This architecture is also called LeNet-5 proposed in 1998 and this model achieved accuracy of more than 99% on training set and 98% accuracy on test set.
